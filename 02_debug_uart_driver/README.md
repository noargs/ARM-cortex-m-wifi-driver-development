## Debug UART Driver 
    
The USART2 interface available on PA2 and PA3 of NUCLEO-F411RE, which is then connected to ST-LINK, (and then to USB).    
    
Which can be used to send the Debug output from NUCLEO to PC and get the result shown via any Serial Capture Tool for PC (i.e. _RealTerm_ for Windows or _SerialTools_ for MacOS)    
    
In order for debug output (USART2) to be seen correctly on Desktop we will keep **Baud Rate** as 115200 **Data bits** as 8, **Stop bits** 1 and **Parity** none
